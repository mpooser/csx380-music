## *Classifying Music by Genre using Machine Learning*

### Abstract

In this study, we construct four different models: Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, and a Multilayer Perceptron; to use four different attributes, estimated tempo (or beats per minute), mean spectral centroid, mean spectral flatness, and root mean squared energy to train four different models to accurately predict one of three genres: Classical, Rock, and Electronic Dance Music (EDM). Our results show that the Naïve Bayes model performed the best in terms of nearly every summary statistic such as accuracy, all four error rates, and ROC/PRC curve compared to the other models. Overall, each of the aforementioned classifier had an accuracy of at least 83% or higher but no more than 86%. Furthermore, our data’s confusion matrices showed that the hardest genre to classify is rock music, while the easiest music to classify is classical music.
